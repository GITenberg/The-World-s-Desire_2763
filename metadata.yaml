description: "The World's Desire is a classic fantasy novel first published in 1890\
  \ and written by H. Rider Haggard and Andrew Lang. Its importance was recognised\
  \ in its later revival in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fortieth volume of\
  \ the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in January 1972.\nThe World's Desire\
  \ is the story of the hero Odysseus, mainly referred to as \"the Wanderer\" for\
  \ the bulk of the novel. Odysseus returns home to Ithaca after his second, unsung\
  \ journey. He is hoping to find a \"home at peace, wife dear and true and his son\
  \ worthy of him\". Unfortunately, he does not find any of the three, instead his\
  \ home is ravaged by a plague and his wife Penelope has been slain. As he grieves,\
  \ he is visited by an old flame, Helen of Troy, for whom the novel is named. Helen\
  \ leads him to equip himself with the Bow of Eurytus and embark on his last journey.\
  \ This is an exhausting journey in which he encounters a Pharaoh who is wed to a\
  \ murderess beauty, a holy and helpful priest, and his own fate.\n From Wikipedia\
